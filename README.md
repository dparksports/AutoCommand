# AutoCommand — see what your Windows PC is really doing, then take it back with one click

![AutoCommand](Assets/corp_banner.png)

A free, open-source security and control dashboard for Windows 10 and 11. One administrator window answers every question that normally costs you an afternoon — *what is this process, who launched it, where is it connecting, how do I make it stop?* — as a row in a table, a colored card, or a single button.

> **⬇ Download** the latest self-contained build from the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/dparksports/autocommand-windows/releases) — no .NET required. Unzip, run `AutoCommand.exe` as Administrator.
>
> **🔧 How it works inside:** every technology below is documented in the [Technical Notes](docs/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md). Apache 2.0.

## Why it exists

Windows spreads the answers across a dozen tools that don't talk to each other. AutoCommand puts the whole picture in one place:

![Why AutoCommand](Assets/corp_why.png)

- **A mystery process is phoning home.** Find the row — process, destination, owner — then block the IP, block the executable, kill the process, or disable the scheduled task that would resurrect it at 3 a.m.
- **You want a record, not a guess.** One click installs Sysmon, and from then on every process launch, connection, and DNS query is recorded locally.
- **An app keeps replacing itself.** Freeze it: the app runs, its updater fails politely, and unfreezing restores the original permissions exactly.
- **Software silently beacons usage stats.** Apply the vendor's own documented opt-out, snapshot the previous value, and verify the beacons actually stopped.

## The tabs

| Tab | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| 🚀 **Quick Scan** | The whole first-hour ritual — debloat, firewall, privacy, hardening — as one guided pass that re-verifies itself. |
| 📡 **Attack Surface** | The network doors Windows ships open: SSTP tunneling, KDNET debug adapters, hosted-network hotspots. Inspect, disable, remove. |
| 🛡 **Firewall** | Curated profiles (lockdown, home-LAN, per-app) in one click over the native `INetFwPolicy2` engine, with drift detection. |
| 📦 **Bloatware** | 23 preinstalled apps removed in one sweep. Use one of them? Toggle it off the list — permanently. |
| 🧭 **Sysmon Audit** | One status card + a live feed of every process launch with full command line and parent. Installed and configured from the app. |
| 🔍 **Process Monitor** | Live grid of outbound connections with packet counters (no WinPcap needed), background reverse-DNS, and attribution that survives process exit. Block, kill, inspect — with warnings before you take out something Windows needs. |
| 🔬 **Svchost Trace** | A timeline over the 70+ `svchost.exe` service hosts — spawns with parents, connection lifetimes, byte flows — plus a pattern detector: bad parents, respawn loops, beacon-regular connections, upload-dominant flows. Exports JSONL; drives a headless capture service with boot auto-start. |
| 📊 **Telemetry** | Known telemetry senders (Edge, Chrome, .NET CLI, VS Code, …), the vendor's own documented opt-out, previous value snapshotted, quiet verified via the DNS cache. |
| 👁 **Privacy** | Microsoft's diagnostic task disabled, AutoCommand's own analytics opt-in, tamper-protection status visible. |
| ❄ **Update Control** | Freeze self-updating apps at the version that works — `icacls` snapshots make unfreezing exact. Windows binaries are refused. |
| 📋 **Tasks · 🚀 Startup · 🌙 Hibernation · 🌐 Connections** | Full Task Scheduler control, startup entries, hibernation posture, and a second live connection view. |
| 🔒 **OS Hardening + ✅ DBX Safety** | Self-healing guards on SSTP/kernel-debug, the Secure Boot chain hashed and watched, DBX revocations applied only with your yes. |
| ⚙ **Settings** | Startup behavior, analytics opt-in, live version — and the status bar's **🚑 Restore Internet** button. |

## Blocked things, managed

Blocking is easy; *un*-blocking is where other tools strand you. AutoCommand:

- **warns before you block** — Microsoft/CDN destinations and DNS-carrying service hosts are flagged with what will break;
- **keeps rules self-describing** — 2 idempotent rules per target with full provenance in the description, readable from `wf.msc`;
- **groups every block in one manager** — Microsoft/Windows rows in red, bulk unblock, legacy 4-rules-per-IP consolidation, and hit counts from the firewall's own drop log (one click to enable);
- **verifies unknown IPs for you** — one button asks the internet registries (RDAP) who owns each target, cached machine-wide;
- **restores you from mistakes** — the status-bar 🚑 button disables every AutoCommand block and flushes DNS in one click; *Restore except Microsoft/Windows* brings your real blocks back while leaving only the breakage-causing ones off.

## What AutoCommand will not do

- **Nothing runs without you.** Removals, applies, freezes, and DBX updates all confirm first.
- **Non-removable means non-offered.** System-signed components never appear in the bloatware list; Windows binaries are never frozen.
- **No hidden state.** Everything the app remembers is readable JSON/text on disk (listed in the [Technical Notes](docs/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md)); its own telemetry is opt-in and off by default.

## Build from source

```powershell
# .NET 10 SDK required
git clone https://github.com/dparksports/autocommand-windows.git
cd autocommand-windows
dotnet build AutoCommand.csproj -c Release

# self-contained build (what the releases ship)
dotnet publish AutoCommand.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
```

Run the published `AutoCommand.exe` as Administrator — WPF, .NET 10, Windows 10 (19041+) / Windows 11.
